# Image Segmentation
Remove irrelevant objects from videos using FCN to solve the semantic segmentation problem. For each new image, we output pixels of the image that belong together semantically. These image segmentation algorithms relies on clustering with additional contour information and edges information.  

FCN-based semantic segmentation is used along with a bit of supervised learning.
